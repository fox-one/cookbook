## The importance of PIN

You only need to know your mobile numbers and remember the PIN instead of complicated addresses and private keys. The phone receives a verification code and you may logs in at any time.

The PIN is very important. Once set, it can only be modified later and cannot be reset. In other words, if you forget your PIN, you will never be able to retrieve your assets.

## How Fox.ONE keep your assets safe?

Most wallets use private keys and mnemonics to secure assets, but Fox.ONE wallet are not designed this way for some reasons.

### What is mnemonic and private key?

The private key is a 64-bit random number, and the mnemonic is a sequence of English words that the algorithm converts the private key into. The conversion between the two is interoperable.

### The problem of mnemonics and private keys

**Loss and Forgetting**: Whether it is a private key or a mnemonic, it is hard to remember that you will forget what numbers and words are, where you hid by yourself. You yourself is your biggest enemy.

**Cyber Theft**: Information security exists in the barrel effect. For the ordinary, it is precisely the shortest board. Theoretically, safest and most reliable mnemonic and private key are often leaked and stolen under improper management.

### PIN and TEE: Simplify the concept, Safe and Reliable

Fox.ONE wallet is based on a decentralized called [Mixin network](https://mixin.one), and the Mixin network uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to secure your assets. In short, the private key is stored in the Mixin network, and the PIN is a key to your private key, which only you can unlock your private key. Unlocking the private key is done under the protection of the trusted execution environment. No matter whether it is a Fox.ONE or a Mixin node, your private key cannot be viewed, thus ensuring the security of your wallet.

All in all, the Fox.ONE wallet maximizes the user experience while keeping assets safe.
